<p>My research interest mainly focused on data mining and AI, especially graph analysis algorithms. In my previous experience, I have conducted research on diffusion network reconstruction and related algorithms. Recently, I am also interested in applying machine learning and embedding techniques into graph mining to solve traditional issues. Currently, I am working with Prof. Xiaokui Xiao at National University of Singapore on graph algorithms.</p>


<p>Brief introductions of some of my research projects are listed below. For more information, you can view the detailed PDF version through link in detailed pages or check my resume through link in the navigation bar. If you are intreseted, do not hesitate to reach me out through email :-)</p>
