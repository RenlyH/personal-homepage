I am Xinhai Hou (Renly), a Ph.D. candidate majoring in Bioinformatics and Scientific Computing at [Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics), [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](www.umich.edu) (Ann Arbor, MI, US). Currently, I am in [MLiNS Lab](https://mlins.org), under the supervision of [Prof. Todd Hollon](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/todd-hollon-md). I got my B.S. in Statistical Science at [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). 


I have a broad interest in many topics in databases, especifically AI4DB. I am devoted to improving the data scientists' pipeline, providing them with easier-to-use and faster-to-execute analytic tools. I am currently focusing on LLMs for databases and efficient query processing.
