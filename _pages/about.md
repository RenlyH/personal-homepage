Hi, I am Yunjia Zhang (张运加), an undergraduate (final year) majored in Computer Science & Technology at [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](www.whu.edu.cn) (China). During the past three years, I have been working together with professors of several departments on many interesting and groundbreaking research projects. My research interest mainly focused on data mining, graph algorithms and generally AI. I have experience working as research assistant in SKLSE @ Wuhan University (supervisor: Prof.Hao Huang), [Institute of Software](http://english.is.cas.cn/) @ Chinese Academy of Sciences (supervisor: Prof.Limin Guo), SCALE @ [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg) (supervisor: [Prof.Gao Cong](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/gaocong/)) and [Database Research Lab](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dbsystem/team.html) @ [National University of Singapore](www.nus.edu.sg) (supervisor: [Prof.Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/)).

<!-- Due to the in-depth study, I am now pursuing graduate degree. I will appreciate it if you reach me out through email ([yunjiazhang@whu.edu.cn](mailto:yunjiazhang@whu.edu.cn)). -->
