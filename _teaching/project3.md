* Video recording
* Picture recording
* Online live
* Family facial recognition 
* Unlisted face alarming
* Gesture control

For the facial recognition and gesture recognition, local recognition programs and FACE++ APIs were applied to provide more accurate recognition result due to the performance limit of our embedded system â€“ Raspberry Pi.
